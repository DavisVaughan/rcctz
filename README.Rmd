# rcctz

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R build status](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/rcctz/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/rcctz/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rcctz is to provide CCTZ headers in the most bare bones way possible.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rcctz from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rcctz")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavisVaughan/rcctz")
```

## Limitations

Because of issues with Windows on R < 4.0.0, the `cctz::parse()` and
`cctz::format()` functions don't currently work and have been removed from
the library. However, CCTZ is extremely useful even without these features. In
the future, they might be added back in.
